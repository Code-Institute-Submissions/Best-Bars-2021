            <h1>DID YOU KNOW?</h1>
            <p>The word cocktail originated in the United States in the 17th century but didn't gain popularity until
                the middle of the 1800s.
                This popularity is thanks in large part to Jerry Thomas, the granddad of mixology, who published his
                bartender's guide in 1862.</p>

            <h1>AFTERNOON DEATH</h1>
            <p>Ernest Hemingway invented this one because of his love of absinthe during his time in France. Death in
                the Afternoon was also his contribution to “So Red the Nose, or Breath in the Afternoon,”
                a 1935 cocktail book featuring recipes from 30 celebrity authors.</p>

            <p>Prohibition in the United States may have banned liquor, but spirits flowed freely in the back alleys,
                speakeasies, and countrysides of America.
                In fact, many of the best cocktails came out of and survived those dry years.</p>
